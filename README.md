# Website Template System 

<b>Last Update: June 21, 2017</b>

** NOTE: I am currently working to make this into a complete starter website templating system. 

** Please feel free to contribute **

This website template system is the perfect place to start your next web design and development project.

<mark>This is not a complete website template, it is not for creating a dynamic website. It is only a starting point in creating a design and should be treated as only a template.</mark>

This website template system will work on any computer.

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Manual Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git and where it says `yourprojectname` enter the name of your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai5le/website-template-system yourprojectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd yourprojectname
npm i && bower i
```

Finally, run `npm start` to start the template system.
